This is a minimal tumblelog inspired by http://project.ioni.st/.


A Post represents, well, a post. It can be one of many kinds: text (url, quote, ..), media (picture, film, audio), and so on.

The LogController welcomes the reader by displaying the latest posts.

The PostController shows single posts, and offers an administrative intarface.
